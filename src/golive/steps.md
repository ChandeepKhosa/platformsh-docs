# Going Live - Steps

Going live on Platform.sh is a simple two or three step process.

<!--toc-->

You can either use the Platform.sh UI or the CLI to configure your project for production. Once you have gone through it once the whole process usually takes a couple of minutes.

> The order of operations is not really important, but if you are migrating a site from an existing provider, you should first configure the domain on the Platform.sh side, and only then switch DNS over.

## 1. Change your plan to a production plan

If you are on a Development plan, you cannot add a domain. You will need to upgrade your subscription to a production plan.

Go to [your account](https://accounts.platform.sh/user), click on the small wheel next to you project's name and click on edit.

Choose the plan you want, it will show you the monthly price you will be paying.

You can find more information on pricing on the [pricing page](https://platform.sh/pricing).

## 2. Set your domain in Platform.sh

This is a required step, it will tell the Platform.sh edge layer where to route requests for your web site. You can do this through the CLI with `platform domain:add example.com` or [using the UI](/administration/web/configure-project.html#domains).

You can add multiple domains to point to your project. Each domain can have its own custom SSL certificate, or use the default one provided.

If you require access to the site before the domain name becomes active you can create a `hosts` file entry on your computer and point it to the IP address that resolves when you access your master project branch.

To get the IP address, first run `platform environment:info edge_hostname`. That will print the "internal" domain name for your project. Run `ping <that domain name>` to get its IP address.

In OS X and Linux you can add that IP to your `/etc/hosts` file. In Windows the file is named `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`. You will need to be a admin user to be able to change that file. So in OS X you will usually run something like `sudo vi /etc/hosts`. After adding the line the file will look something like:

![Hosts File](/images/hosts-file.png)

> **note**
> Do not put the IP address you see here, but the one you got from the ping command.
> _Also, remember to remove this entry after you have configured DNS!_

Sometimes it can take Let's Encrypt a couple of minutes to provision the certificate the first time. This is normal, and only means the first deploy after enabling a domain may take longer than usual.

## 3. Configure your DNS provider

Configure your DNS provider to point your domain to your Platform.sh Master environment domain name.

The way to do so will vary somewhat depending on your registrar, but nearly all registrars should allow you to set a CNAME. Some will call it an Alias or similar alternate name, but either way the intent is to say "this domain should always resolve to... this other domain".

You can access the CNAME target by running `platform environment:info edge_hostname`. That is the host name by which Platform.sh knows your environment. Add a CNAME record from your desired domain (`www.example.com`) to the value of the `edge_hostname`.

If you have multiple domains you want to be served by the same application you will need to add a CNAME record for each of them.

Note that depending on your registrar and the TTL you set, it could take anywhere from 15 minutes to 72 hours for the DNS change to fully propagate across the Internet.

If you are using an apex domain (`example.com`), see the additional information about [Apex domains and CNAME records](/golive/steps/dns.md).

## 4. Bonus steps (Optional)

### Configure health notifications

While not required, it's strongly recommended that you set up [health notifications](/administration/integrations/notifications.md) to advise you if your site is experiencing issues such as running low on disk space. Notifications can be sent via email, Slack, or PagerDuty.

### Configure production cron tasks

It's strongly recommended that you [set up automatic snapshots](/administration/snapshot-and-restore.md#automated-snapshots) and [automatic certificate renewal](/configuration/routes/https.md#automatic-certificate-renewal) cron tasks. You will first need to set up an [API token](/gettingstarted/cli/api-tokens.md) and install the CLI as part of the build hook. Then you can easily configure the appropriate cron tasks. The following snippet is generally sufficient but see the the links above for more details, and please modify the cron schedules listed to match your use case.

```yaml
crons:
  snapshot:
    # Take a snapshot automatically every night at 3 am (UTC).
    spec: "0 3 * * *"
    cmd: |
      if [ "$PLATFORM_BRANCH" = master ]; then
          platform snapshot:create --yes --no-wait
      fi
  renewcert:
    # Force a redeploy at 8 am (UTC) on the 14th and 28th of every month.
    spec: "0 8 14,28 * *"
    cmd: |
      if [ "$PLATFORM_BRANCH" = master ]; then
          platform redeploy --yes --no-wait
      fi
```
