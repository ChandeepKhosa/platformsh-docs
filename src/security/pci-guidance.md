# PCI DSS Responsibility Guidance

Platform.sh has many PCI certified customers using our services. Some aspects of PCI compliance are the responsibility of the host and others are the responsibility of the application developer.

Basic PCI questions can be handled by our support team via a ticket. For more advanced questions or walk-through of a full audit please contact your Platform.sh Account Manager.

## Overview

Platform.sh provides a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution which our customers may use to store, process, or transmit cardholder data.

## Security & Compensating Controls

- For those customers needing to meet SAQ C or SAQ D, a Platform.sh Enterprise Plan may be needed in order to fully meet your needs. Please [contact us](https://platform.sh/contact) for more information.

- For a list of security measures, please see our [Security page](https://platform.sh/security).

- Please take note that customer environments are deployed in a read-only instance, segregated with GRE and IPSEC tunnels, which often permits compensating controls to be claimed for several PCI requirements.

- Because customers can use our PaaS in a variety of ways, the best approach with auditors is to focus is on “What do I, the customer, control/configure and how is it managed in a compliant manner?”

## Responsibility

Platform.sh customers are ultimately responsible for their own PCI DSS compliance.

The following sections provide guidance on shared responsibilities to achieve PCI DSS compliance. The list below covers all the sections found in a typical SAQ D although you may not need this level of detail for your efforts. This section is currently using PCI DSS 3.2 as a reference.
