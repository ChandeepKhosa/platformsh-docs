# Snapshot and Restore

## Snapshots

Snapshots are triggered directly via the Web Interface or via the CLI. The snapshot creates a complete backup of the environment. It includes all persistent data from all running services (MySQL, SOLR,...) and any files stored on the mounted volumes.

You need to have the "admin" role in order to create a snapshot of an environment.

> **note**
>
> We advise you to make snapshots of your live environment before merging an environment to the live environment, or each time you increase the storage space of your services.

Using the CLI:

```bash
$ platform snapshot:create
```

Please be aware that triggering a snapshot will cause a momentary pause in site availability so that all requests can complete, allowing the snapshot to be taken against a known consistent state.  The total interruption is usually only 1-2 seconds and any requests during that time are held temporarily, not dropped.

## Restore

You will see the snapshot in the activity feed of you environment in the Platform.sh Web Interface. You can trigger the restore by clicking on the `restore` link.

From the CLI, you can list existing snapshots with the CLI as follows:

```bash
$ platform snapshots

You can restore a specific snapshot with the CLI as follows:

```bash
$ platform snapshot:restore 92c9a4b2aa75422efb3d
```

> **note**
> You need "admin" role to restore your environment from a snapshot.

## Automated snapshots

No snapshot is triggered automatically on Platform.sh Standard. You can trigger your snapshot via the Web Interface or via the CLI.

Snapshots may be triggered from an automated system, such as cron, Jenkins, or another CI service by calling the CLI.  To enable backups automatically using just Platform.sh, see the section on [API tokens](/administration/cli/api-tokens.md) for installing the CLI in the app container.

Once the CLI is installed and an API token configured you can add a cron task to run once a day and trigger a snapshot.  The CLI will read the existing environment variables in the container and default to the project and environment it is running on.  However, in most cases such backups are only useful on the `master` production environment.  That can be achieved like so:

```yaml
crons:
    snapshot:
        spec: '0 5 * * *'
        cmd: |
            if [ "$PLATFORM_BRANCH" = master ]; then
                platform snapshot:create --yes --no-wait
            fi
```

The above cron task will run once a day at 5 am (UTC), and, if the current environment is the master branch, it will run `platform snapshot:create` on the current project and environment.  The `--yes` flag will skip any user-interaction.  The `--no-wait` flag will cause the command to complete immediately rather than waiting for the snapshot to complete.

> **note**
> 
> It is very important to include the `--no-wait` flag.  If you do not, the cron process will block and you will be unable to deploy new versions of the site until the snapshot creation process is complete.

We ask that you not schedule a backup task more than once a day to minimize data usage. As a snapshot does cause a momentary pause in service we recommend running during non-peak hours for your site.


### Retention

We guarantee that your snapshots are kept for at least 7 days.
