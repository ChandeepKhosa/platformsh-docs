# Elasticsearch (Search Service)

Elasticsearch is a distributed RESTful search engine built for the cloud.

See the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html) for more information.

## Supported versions

* 0.90
* 1.4
* 1.7
* 2.4
* 5.2

## Relationship

The format exposed in the `$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` [environment variable](/administration/variables.md#platformsh-provided-variables):

```json
{
    "elasticsearch": [
        {
            "host": "248.0.65.198",
            "scheme": "http",
            "port": "9200"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Usage example

In your `.platform/services.yaml`:

```yaml
mysearch:
    type: elasticsearch:5.2
    disk: 1024
```

In your `.platform.app.yaml`:

```yaml
relationships:
    elasticsearch: "mysearch:elasticsearch"
```

You can then use the service in a configuration file of your application with something like:

```php
<?php
// This assumes a fictional application with an array named $settings.
if (getenv('PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS')) {
	$relationships = json_decode(base64_decode($relationships), TRUE);

	// For a relationship named 'elasticsearch' referring to one endpoint.
	if (!empty($relationships['elasticsearch'])) {
		foreach ($relationships['elasticsearch'] as $endpoint) {
			$settings['elasticsearch_host'] = $endpoint['host'];
			$settings['elasticsearch_port'] = $endpoint['port'];
			break;
		}
	}
}
```

> **note**
>
> When you create an index on Elasticsearch, you should not specify `number_of_shards` and `number_of_replicas` settings in your Elasticsearch API call. These values will be set automatically based on available resources.


## Plugins

The Elasticsearch 2.4 and later services offer a number of plugins.  To enable them, list them under the `configuration.plugins` key in your `services.yaml` file, like so:

```yaml
mysearch:
    type: "elasticsearch:5.2"
    disk: 1024
    configuration:
        plugins:
            - analysis-icu
            - lang-python
            
```

In this example you'd have the ICU analysis plugin and Python script support plugin.

If there is a publicly available plugin you need that is not listed here, please contact our support team.
